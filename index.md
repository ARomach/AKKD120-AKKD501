## Course Description

*Meeting time and place*: TThu 11:15am-12:30pm, SML 323 \\
*Instructor*: Avital Romach\\
*Email*: avital.romach@yale.edu\\
*Office hours*: by appointment; I will also stay after class time for any further questions\\
*Prerequisites*: Elementary Akkadian I 

This course is a continuation of [Elementary Akkadian I](https://aromach.github.io/AKKD110-AKKD500/){:target="_blank"}. Akkadian was one of the primary languages of ancient Mesopotamia (modern Iraq), with an attested history of more than 2000 years (from the second half of the 3rd millennium BCE to the beginning of the Common Era). It is a Semitic language, similar to Arabic, Aramaic, and Hebrew, written on clay tablets in the Cuneiform script. Hundreds of thousands of documents in Akkadian have come down to us. They include everything from great works of literature like the Gilgamesh Epic, to everyday texts such as letters that document the lives of people from all walks of life, from great kings to commoners and slaves. Whether it be a letter to a paranoid emperor who refuses to eat and shuts himself in his own palace, or a particularly inept spy reporting to his superiors about the suspicious dreams of a suspected enemy of the state, knowledge of Akkadian opens a window into the world of those who lived thousands of years ago, the struggles they faced and the stories they told. Akkadian for Beginners provides students with the tools to begin to explore that ancient and once-forgotten world of ancient Mesopotamia. After finishing the course, students will have acquired a sound knowledge of Akkadian grammar and syntax, along with practice in cuneiform.

## Goals and Objectives

Students at the end of this course will be able to be confident in reading most Akkadian text genres from the Old Babylonain period in transliteration and some from cuneiform hand-copies. They will be able to easily identify common Akkadian words and common cuneiform signs from memory. They will be familiar with using the main dictionaries in the field (CDA, CAD, and SAD; see further below) and online resources for Akkadian and cuneiform texts. Students will be ready to take intermediate and advanced Akkadian classes which can include reading texts from other periods and dialects of Akkadian.

More specifically, the course has the following goals:
- cover remaining topics of Akkadian grammar, with an emphasis on the Old Babylonian dialect (ca. 1800 BCE)
- learn remaining common Akkadian vocabulary
- learn remaining common cuneiform signs in their Old Babylonian monumental and cursive forms
- gain familiarity and confidence with cuneiform hand-copies (i.e. non-computerized sign forms)
- become familiar with additional genres of texts, in addition to Hammurabi's law code and contracts (letters, omens, royal inscriptions, hymns, and literary texts)
- know how to use the main print and online resources for deciphering Akkadian texts

## Schedule and Grading

The class meets twice a week. In the first meeting of every week, we will read and discuss the cultural-historical context of the texts assigned for homework, primarily from cuneiform (even if the texts were assigned in transliteration). In the second, we will learn and practice new grammatical concepts and vocabulary.

For the full class schedule, see under [Schedule and Homework]({{ site.baseurl }}/schedule-and-homework).

Grading is as follows:

- 5% Lemma biographies presentations
- 5% Weekly vocab quizzes
- 10% Sign list preparation
- 20% Midterm exam
- 20% Final exam
- 40% HW preparation and active class participation

**Lemma biographies presentations**: each student will have to give *at least once* a five-minute presentation on a few Akkadian words of their choice. The presentation should include the common meanings of the words, summarized from the dictionaries and online resources. These presentations will begin on the fourth week of the semester. Students can choose as many words as they want, as long as their presentation does not take more or less then five minutes.

**Weekly vocab quizzes**: there will be two quizzes to complete per week outside of class time in Google forms: one covering just the new vocabulary learned that week, and another with a sample of all the vocabulary learned thus far. <u>Participation is enough for credit, not correct answers</u>. Nevertheless, you can take the vocabulary quizzes multiple times, and it is highly recommended to do so until you get all correct answers.

**Sign list preparation**: each student will have to prepare two sign list, one for monumental script and another for cursive script. A sign list organizes cuneiform signs according to a visual principle, so that it will be possible to search through signs based on their appearance. Students can organize the signs based on existing organizational methods in the field, or based on their own method of linking and association. They will be submitted throughout the semester to ensure consistent progress, in electronic form (preferably an Excel or Google Spreadsheet file).

**Midterm and Final exams**: exams will include texts in transliteration and cuneiform, covering genres and grammar learned thus far. Students will need to transliterate or parse verbs, as well as normalize and translate. A detailed explanation on the structure of each exam will be given a week in advance.

**HW preparation and active class participation**: we will read texts assigned for homework together in class. Students must come prepared having already **transliterated, normalized, translated, and parsed all verbs before class**. **Attendance is mandatory**: if you have to miss a class, please let me know in advance in person or via email and provide the reason. Only one unexcused absence is permitted each semester, without affecting the grade.
