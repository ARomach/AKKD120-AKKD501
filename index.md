Akkadian was one of the primary languages of ancient Mesopotamia (modern Iraq), with an attested history of more than 2000 years (from the second half of the 3rd millennium BCE to the beginning of the Common Era). It is a Semitic language, similar to Arabic, Aramaic, and Hebrew, written on clay tablets in the Cuneiform script. Hundreds of thousands of documents in Akkadian have come down to us. They include everything from great works of literature like the Gilgamesh Epic, to everyday texts such as letters that document the lives of people from all walks of life, from great kings to commoners and slaves. Whether it be a letter to a paranoid emperor who refuses to eat and shuts himself in his own palace, or a particularly inept spy reporting to his superiors about the suspicious dreams of a suspected enemy of the state, knowledge of Akkadian opens a window into the world of those who lived thousands of years ago, the struggles they faced and the stories they told. Akkadian for Beginners provides students with the tools to begin to explore that ancient and once-forgotten world of ancient Mesopotamia. After finishing the course, students will have acquired a sound knowledge of Akkadian grammar and syntax, along with practice in Cuneiform.

## Goals and Objectives

Students will learn the essentials of Old Babylonian grammar (ca. 1800 BCE), common Akkadian vocabulary, and the cuneiform writing system. They will read selected Old Babylonian texts from a wide range of genres including economic documents, letters, omens, royal inscriptions, and excerpts from the famous Law Code of Hammurabi, preparing them for further reading courses in cuneiform studies. Students will also be introduced to the Yale Babylonian Collection, the largest collection of cuneiform tablets in the US. Through reading ancient texts, lectures will illuminate Mesopotamian history and culture. This course is intended as a gateway to further study of ancient Mesopotamia.

## Required Materials

The course book we will use is:

- Huehnergard, J. *A Grammar of Akkadian*. (3rd edition) Eisenbrauns: Winona Lake IN, 2011.

Purchasing a paper copy is **not mandatory**. The book is freely available as a PDF through the [Academia website](https://www.academia.edu/234695/2011_A_Grammar_of_Akkadian_3rd_edition){:target="_blank"} (registration is required for download but free).

Homework and reading assignments are from Huehnergard’s grammar. Also, the dictionary and sign list at the end of the book will be utilized for all exams.


## Schedule and Grading

The class meets twice a week. In the first weekly meeting, we will go over homework together. In the second, we will learn and practice new grammatical concepts and vocabulary. Each lesson will also begin with a warm-up exercise for studying cuneiform signs.

For the full class schedule, see under [Schedule and Homework]({{ site.baseurl }}/schedule-and-homework).

Grading is as follows:

- 5% Cuneiform class exercises
- 5% Weekly vocab quizzes
- 10% Two take-home quarter quizzes
- 15% Midterm exam
- 20% Final exam
- 45% HW preparation and active class participation

**Cuneiform class exercises**: we will have joint exercises and quizzes in class. <u>Participation is enough for credit, not correct answers</u>. Each student will also need to give a “sign biography” at least once during the semester.

**Weekly vocab quizzes**: There will be two quizzes to complete per week outside of class time in Google forms: one covering just the new vocabulary learned that week, and another with a sample of all the vocabulary learned thus far. <u>Participation is enough for credit, not correct answers</u>. Nevertheless, you can take the vocabulary quizzes multiple times, and it is highly recommended to do so until you get all correct answers.

**Two take-home quarter quizzes, Midterm exam, and Final exam**: These exams will include sentences (or texts) in Akkadian to normalize, parse, and translate. They may also include some cuneiform exercises. The quarter quizzes will be significantly shorter, and are meant primarily as practice for the midterm and final exams. A detailed explanation on the structure of each exam or quiz will be given a week in advance.

**HW preparation and active class participation**: We will check homework together in class. Students must come prepared having already completed the homework before class. **Attendance is mandatory**: if you have to miss a class, please let me know in advance in person or via email and provide the reason. Only one unexcused absence is permitted each semester, without affecting the grade.
