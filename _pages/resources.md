This course website is the main resource for following week by week assignments (under [Schedule and Homework]({{ site.baseurl }}/schedule-and-homework)).

Below additional resources are organized according to categories: vocabulary and consonants, cuneiform related, and general.

## Vocabulary and Consonants

- Vocabulary organized according to Huehnergard’s chapters is available through a [Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cOzJwrJuwKuhsvXzZ25GANkObBirXbcOlWSgbtCCMLI/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}. WARNING: the vocabulary was automatically extracted from the PDF and may include some mistakes. I will validate each week’s new vocabulary before the beginning of that week, but I caution against using the full vocabulary at once.
- A list of the Akkadian consonants with their Hebrew equivalents and IPA reconstructed articulation can be accessed through this [Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gJ_Y9hGenTmyctCmNS8GP41pZ8sstyTUU479G514CR4/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}.
- A [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uqQI68RR6n8z9F3zHT2BRzxocHWRlIwR-q0zvRDQX9o/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} detailing how to use the [ORACC keyboard](https://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/doc/help/visitingoracc/keyboards/index.html){:target="_blank"} for special cuneiform transliteration characters (tlit).


## Cuneiform related

- A link to the [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uidea4TIov6F4jxMKwtg00b-RLL33N5o?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} where you can find images of cuneiform signs to study, organized according to Huehnergard's chapters. In each image, the sign on the left is the monumental OB version, and on the right is the cursive OB version.
- A PDF of Labat's [Manual d'epigraphie akkadienne](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nvoGlNfz9dJgBGuZQ-4uloZ-SALPQO32/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}, for examining earlier forms of signs.
- The [Aggregated Cuneiform Resources Lookup](https://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/osl/ACRL/index.html){:target="_blank"} of the ORACC global sign list: a resource to view cropped images of specific signs from cuneiform tablets according to period.
- The [electronic Babylonian Library's (eBL) Signs search](https://www.ebl.lmu.de/signs){:target="_blank"}: a resource to view cropped images of specific signs from cuneiform tablets according to period.
- [Unicode fonts for cuneiform](https://www.hethport.uni-wuerzburg.de/cuneifont/){:target="_blank"} through the Hethitologie Portal Mainz: if you wish to download cuneiform fonts to your computer, you can use the link to access the available fonts. Each font represents a different period or style of cuneiform writing. For this class, we will focus on OB monumental and cursive. At the Downloads section at the right side of the linked webpage, you will find "Old Babylonian Fonts": press it and a folder will be downloaded to your computer containing two fonts: Santakku (OB cursive) and SantakkuM (OB monumental). Double click the files to install them.

## General

- [eHammurabi](https://ehammurabi.org/){:target="_blank"} is a website and tool for viewing the laws of Hammurabi from hand-copy, transliteration, normalization, and translation. You can also use the Stele3D view to see the laws' locations on the Stele of Hammurabi.
