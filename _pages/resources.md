This course website is the main resource for following week by week assignments (under [Schedule and Homework]({{ site.baseurl }}/schedule-and-homework)).

Below additional resources are organized according to categories: [vocabulary and consonants](#vocabulary-and-consonants), [cuneiform related](#cuneiform-related), [cuneiform sign lists](#cuneiform-sign-lists), [Akkadian dictionaries](#akkadian-dictionaries), and [online resources for Akkadian](#online-resources-for-akkadian).

## Vocabulary and Consonants

- Vocabulary organized according to Huehnergard’s chapters is available through a [Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cOzJwrJuwKuhsvXzZ25GANkObBirXbcOlWSgbtCCMLI/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}. WARNING: the vocabulary was automatically extracted from the PDF and may include some mistakes. I will validate each week’s new vocabulary before the beginning of that week, but I caution against using the full vocabulary at once.
- A list of the Akkadian consonants with their Hebrew equivalents and IPA reconstructed articulation can be accessed through this [Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gJ_Y9hGenTmyctCmNS8GP41pZ8sstyTUU479G514CR4/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}.

## Online Resources for Akkadian

- [eHammurabi](https://ehammurabi.org/){:target="_blank"} is a website and tool for viewing the laws of Hammurabi from hand-copy, transliteration, normalization, and translation. You can also use the Stele3D view to see the laws' locations on the Stele of Hammurabi.
- Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative ([CDLI](https://cdli.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/){:target="_blank"}): The CDLI is one of the earliest online databases for assyriology, which holds metadata for cuneiform tablets such as provenience, collection, publication, size, etc. Some of the entries include digital editions in ATF format, and also include an image of the object, a hand-copy of the object, or both. The updated CDLI platform includes several useful tools such as a transliteration checker, sign lists, year names, score editions, and assyriological abbreviations, to name a few.
- Open Richly-Annotated Cuneiform Corpus ([ORACC](http://oracc.org/){:target="_blank"}): ORACC is one of the largest online databases of digital cuneiform text editions. It is made up of several sub-projects, each of which collects cuneiform texts according to period and/or genre. Each sub-project is led by different teams of scholars. It utilizes the ATF format as well as XML and JSON to create lemmatized editions, and individual glossaries per sub-project. Outside of the individual projects, it includes several help pages on working and editing texts in ATF format.
- Archives Babyloniennes ([Archibab](https://www.archibab.fr/){:target="_blank"}): Archibab holds textual editions of documents from the Old Babylonian period (20th-17th centuries BCE). In addition to online editions, it includes a searchable bibliography of secondary publications relevant to the period, and information on seals. An introduction to the project, its design, purpose, and functionalities, can be found in the following article: Charpin, Dominique. (2014). The Assyriologist and the Computer: The “Archibab” Project. Hebrew Bible and Ancient Israel. 3. [10.1628/219222714X13994465496947](https://doi.org/10.1628/219222714X13994465496947){:target="_blank"}.

The eBL website contains text editions for tablet fragments under the Fragmentarium, as well as updated and lemmatized score editions of some of the most important works of Akkadian literature, accompanied by English translations. It also makes available in digital forms sign lists and Akkadian dictionaries that were previously only in print.

In addition to textual editions with metadata on collection, provenance, etc., SEAL includes an Akkadian vocabulary search, bibliography, and a map showing the findspots of the tablets in the corpus.
- Old Assyrian Research Environment ([OARE](https://oare.byu.edu/){:target="_blank"}): The OARE is intended to facilitate study of the Old Assyrian textual corpus from Kültepe Level II and Kültepe Level Ib.
