This course website is the main resource for following week by week assignments (under [Schedule and Homework]({{ site.baseurl }}/schedule-and-homework)).

Below additional resources are organized according to categories: vocabulary and consonants, Akkadian Dictionaries, cuneiform related, and general.

## Vocabulary and Consonants

- Vocabulary organized according to Huehnergard’s chapters is available through a [Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cOzJwrJuwKuhsvXzZ25GANkObBirXbcOlWSgbtCCMLI/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}. WARNING: the vocabulary was automatically extracted from the PDF and may include some mistakes. I will validate each week’s new vocabulary before the beginning of that week, but I caution against using the full vocabulary at once.
- A list of the Akkadian consonants with their Hebrew equivalents and IPA reconstructed articulation can be accessed through this [Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gJ_Y9hGenTmyctCmNS8GP41pZ8sstyTUU479G514CR4/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}.
- A [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uqQI68RR6n8z9F3zHT2BRzxocHWRlIwR-q0zvRDQX9o/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} detailing how to use the [ORACC keyboard](https://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/doc/help/visitingoracc/keyboards/index.html){:target="_blank"} for special cuneiform transliteration characters (tlit).


## Cuneiform related

- A link to the [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uidea4TIov6F4jxMKwtg00b-RLL33N5o?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} where you can find images of cuneiform signs to study, organized according to Huehnergard's chapters. In each image, the sign on the left is the monumental OB version, and on the right is the cursive OB version.
- A PDF of Labat's [Manual d'epigraphie akkadienne](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nvoGlNfz9dJgBGuZQ-4uloZ-SALPQO32/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}, for examining earlier forms of signs.
- The [Aggregated Cuneiform Resources Lookup](https://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/osl/ACRL/index.html){:target="_blank"} of the ORACC global sign list: a resource to view cropped images of specific signs from cuneiform tablets according to period.
- The [electronic Babylonian Library's (eBL) Signs search](https://www.ebl.lmu.de/signs){:target="_blank"}: a resource to view cropped images of specific signs from cuneiform tablets according to period.
- [Unicode fonts for cuneiform](https://www.hethport.uni-wuerzburg.de/cuneifont/){:target="_blank"} through the Hethitologie Portal Mainz: if you wish to download cuneiform fonts to your computer, you can use the link to access the available fonts. Each font represents a different period or style of cuneiform writing. For this class, we will focus on OB monumental and cursive. At the Downloads section at the right side of the linked webpage, you will find "Old Babylonian Fonts": press it and a folder will be downloaded to your computer containing two fonts: Santakku (OB cursive) and SantakkuM (OB monumental). Double click the files to install them.

## Dictionaries

- A Concise Dictionary of Akkadian (CDA): available as PDF through [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/AConsiceDictionaryAkkadian/mode/2up){:target="_blank"} and a digital version of the CDA is available through the [eBL platform](https://www.ebl.lmu.de/dictionary){:target="_blank"}. As its name indicates, the CDA provides more concise definitions of each lemma, without quotations from primary sources.
- The Chicago Assyrian Dictionary (CAD): available through the [Institute for the Study of Ancient Cultures of the University of Chicago website](https://isac.uchicago.edu/research/publications/chicago-assyrian-dictionary){:target="_blank"}. The CAD provides in-depth definitions for each lemma, including citations from lexical lists for Sumerian equivalents and quotations from primary sources.
- Supplement to the Akkadian Dictionaries (SAD): available at the [Leipzig University website](https://www.gkr.uni-leipzig.de/en/draft/altorientalisches-institut/forschung/supplement-to-the-akkadian-dictionaries){:target="_blank"}. SAD complements particularly the CAD with additional quotations and interpretations based on texts which were published after the CAD volumes were concluded.
